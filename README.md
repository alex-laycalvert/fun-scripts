# fun-scripts

### Installation (kind of)

You can clone the entire repo with:  
`git clone https://github.com/alex-laycalvert/fun-scripts.git`

Then you can run the script of your choice with:

```
chmod +x fun-scripts/<script>.sh
/path/to/fun-scripts/<script>.sh
```

Or follow the instruction on the README of the script itself.

**_NOTE_**: You should probably read the script itself before running random scripts you find on the internet. Just sayin'.
