### christmas.sh

This is slightly modified from [this script by sergiolepore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiolepore/ChristBASHTree/e757367e54e4d95166d9037b31211ad087e246fe/tree-EN.sh) to center the tree vertically.

I would tell you that this is not [this Christmas Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Tree_EXEC) but would you really believe me?
