# fun-scripts

#### IN PROGRESS

I'm still working on making/modifying/collecting programs so there's no much here right now. Just give me som time OK? Jeez you're always on my back mom!

### Installation (kind of)

You can clone the entire repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/alex-laycalvert/fun-scripts.git
```

Then you can run the script of your choice with:

```
chmod +x fun-scripts/<script>.sh
/path/to/fun-scripts/<script>.sh
```

Or follow the instruction on the README of the script itself.

**_NOTE_**: You should probably read the script itself before running random scripts you find on the internet. Just sayin'.
